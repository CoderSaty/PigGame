# Rules

- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds.

- In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he whishes. Each result get added to his current ROUND score.

- BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all his current ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next
player's turn

- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his current ROUND score gets added to his GLOBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn

- The first player to reach 100 points (by default) or the score specified on the input field on GLOBAL score wins the game

- This game is famously known as <b>PigGame</b>

# Features

- A player looses his ENTIRE score when he rolls two 6 in a row. After that, it's the next player's turn.
- There will be an input field where players can set their own winning score, so that they can change the predefined score of 100.
- Add another dice to the game, so that there are two dices now. The player looses his current score when one of them is a 1.For this we have another JS file named twodice.js in js folder of assests. To play with two dice we have to add that file in our html code and disable the app.js file or you can just replace app.js with twodice.js in the index.html file.
