            <h1>GAME RULES:</h1>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>The game has 2 players, playing in rounds.</li>
                <br>
                <li>In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he whishes. Each result get added to his
                    current ROUND score.</li>
                <br>
                <li>BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all his current ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next
                    player's turn</li>
                <br>
                <li> The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his current ROUND score gets added to his GLOBAL
                    score. After that, it's the next player's turn</li>
                <br>
                <li>The first player to reach 100 points on GLOBAL score wins the game
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>This game is famously known as <b>PigGame</b></li>
                <br>
            </ul>
            <h1>ADDITIONAL FEATURES:</h1>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>A player looses his ENTIRE score when he rolls two 6 in a row. After that, it's the next player's
                    turn.</li>
                <br>
                <li>There will be an input field where players can set their own winning score, so that they can change
                    the predefined score of 100.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Add another dice to the game, so that there are two dices now. The player looses his current score
                    when one of them is a 1.</li>
                <br>
